# Digits Recognition from an LCD panel using OpenCV and Python
This project was inspired by the question asked on the [Image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc/t/extract-numbers-from-image/55224)  

Goal: To recognize the digits in the following image:

Here is the Google Colab which recognizes digits in the above image.

This program prints the detected digits from left to right as:
[1, 2, 7, 3, 1, 3]
