# Digits Recognition from an LCD panel using OpenCV and Python
This project was inspired by the question asked on the [Image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc/t/extract-numbers-from-image/55224)  

Goal: To recognize the digits in the following image:

Using [excellent guide available here](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/02/13/recognizing-digits-with-opencv-and-python/), I put together the following Google Colab which recognizes digits in the above image.

## Results

Above Colab also prints the detected digits from left to right as:
[1, 2, 7, 3, 1, 3]
